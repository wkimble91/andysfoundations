                Andy began his career in the concrete construction industry as a teen working for his father, William
                Downey, the founder of Downey Foundation Inc., located in the Shawnee/Merriam KS area. At the time of
                his father's retirement in 1985, Andy was named President and ran his father's business for many years.
                Andy began his own concrete construction business known as Andy's Foundations LLC in 2018. The four
                longest-tenured employees at Andy's Foundations LLC began their careers with Downey Foundation Inc. and
                have a combined 120 years of experience in the industry.

                Foundation Inc. At the time of the corporation's leadership change, Roger was promoted as Foreman of the
                construction crew and has been highly instrumental in the quality work that Downey Foundation Inc. and
                Andy's Foundations LLC have generated over the past few decades.
